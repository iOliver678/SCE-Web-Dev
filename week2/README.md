# Overview
We introduced JavaScript as the language that brings interactivity and logic to web pages. Students learned how JavaScript connects with HTML/CSS to make dynamic websites, how the browser runs scripts, and how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model). We also touched on core concepts like variables, functions, conditionals, and loops. By the end of the week, students had a strong foundation in writing basic JavaScript and understanding how it fits into the structure of full web applications.

On Day 2, we expanded into more advanced topics like asynchronous code, event handling, and the concept of 3-tier architecture (frontend, backend, and database). We explored RESTful APIs and how client-server communication works using HTTP requests. Students got hands-on experience by building a small server using Express.js.

## Day 1
**Slides**: [Intro to Javascript](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lk8UGliVYyyAl2OZP7WH7pTb4UrDcT2UUYvcpKWLIUM/edit?usp=sharing) <br>
We went over basic javascript and did lab.

## Day 2
**Slides**: [Advanced Javascript](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10naRjFBlVkg2bn4IORi57H4mPQd3hTK1kxwqn3DF-18/edit?usp=sharing) <br>
We went over more javascript and also talked about the 3 tier architecture. Essentially REST.
Below are some resources to learn more about API's and servers. There is a project for this day that 
goes over how to make your own server using express.js.
