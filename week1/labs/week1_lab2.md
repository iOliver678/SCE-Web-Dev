# Lab 2 — Style the Food Page (Beginner CSS)

> You are given unstyled HTML for a simple food site (“Tasty Bites”). **Do not change the HTML structure.**  
> Your task is to add CSS to make it look cleaner and easier to read.

---

## Objectives

- Practice adding **colors, padding, and borders**
- Style text with **fonts, sizes, and alignment**
- Add a simple **hover effect** to tabs or sidebar items
- Make images look neat with borders or rounded corners

---

## What You Get

- `index.html` (provided, unstyled — Food page)
- `styles.css` (empty)

> **Rule:** Edit only `styles.css`. Do not change the HTML file.

---

## Tasks

### Step 1 — Base Styles

- Set a font for the whole page (`Arial` or another sans-serif)
- Add a light background color to the whole page
- Make text color dark gray for readability

**Checkpoint**

- [ ] The page has a consistent font
- [ ] Background color is not plain white
- [ ] Text is easy to read

---

### Step 2 — Top Bar (Header)

- Give the top bar a background color (e.g., a warm red or any brand color)
- Add padding so the text isn’t squished
- Add a border at the bottom to separate it from the rest of the page
- Light hover underline on the header nav items

**Checkpoint**

- [ ] Header has a background color
- [ ] Padding makes it taller
- [ ] Bottom border line separates it
- [ ] Nav items show a hover effect

---

### Step 3 — Sidebar (Categories)

- Give the sidebar a light background color
- Add padding inside so text doesn’t touch the edges
- Add a border and (optionally) rounded corners
- On hover, change the background color of each category item

**Checkpoint**

- [ ] Sidebar looks like a separate box
- [ ] Category items change color when hovered

---

### Step 4 — Main Content

- Add some margin or visual separation around the main area
- Style the main heading (`h1`) to be bigger and bold
- Style section headings (`h2`) with a different color (e.g., same as header color family)

**Checkpoint**

- [ ] Main content has space around it
- [ ] Headings stand out from normal text

---

### Step 5 — Tabs (Menu Filters)

- Make the tabs look like simple “chips” or buttons:
  - Add background color, padding, and a bit of border-radius
  - Change color slightly when hovered
- Make the **first tab** look “active” (bolder or darker)

**Hint:** The tabs are the `<p>` elements inside the `#tabs` container.

**Checkpoint**

- [ ] Tabs look clickable
- [ ] Hover effect works
- [ ] First tab looks active

---

### Step 6 — Featured Dish Card

- Give the featured card a light background and a subtle border
- Add padding inside the card
- Style the featured image: full width, rounded corners (small radius)
- Make the featured dish title (`h3`) bold and slightly larger than normal text

**Checkpoint**

- [ ] Card looks like a neat box
- [ ] Image fits the box with rounded corners
- [ ] Featured title stands out

---

### Step 7 — Menu Highlights

- Add spacing between each menu item card (each `<article>`)
- Give each item a simple border or a light shadow and rounded corners
- Ensure images are not too tall and have consistent width (100% of the card)
- Make the dish names (`h3`) bold; prices easy to spot

**Checkpoint**

- [ ] Menu items look like a tidy grid/list
- [ ] Images are consistent and not stretched
- [ ] Titles and prices are easy to read

---

## Final Verification

- [ ] Page has a background color and consistent font
- [ ] Header, sidebar, main, and cards are clearly separated
- [ ] Tabs look interactive with a visible “active” tab
- [ ] Hover effects work on tabs and/or sidebar items
- [ ] Featured image and menu item images look neat (no distortion)
- [ ] Menu items are easy to scan (title, description, price)

---

## Stretch Goals (Optional)

- Add **rounded corners** and a **soft shadow** to sidebar and cards
- Add a tiny **badge style** (e.g., “New” or “Spicy”) next to one menu item title
- Try making the tabs slightly different sizes (padding) to feel more like real chips

## Submission

- `index.html` (unchanged)
- `styles.css` (your work)
- A screenshot of your styled page
