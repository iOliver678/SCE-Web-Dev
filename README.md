All of SCE Web Dev stuff. Created by Oliver Majano.

## Week 1: HTML/CSS

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the structure of a webpage. It uses tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<div>` to organize content such as text, images, and links.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the presentation of that content. It adds styling—like colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, and responsiveness—so the page looks polished and user-friendly.

Together, HTML builds the skeleton, and CSS provides the design.

## Week 2: JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and logic to web pages. It lets you respond to user actions, update content dynamically, and connect with external data (like APIs), making sites interactive rather than just static HTML/CSS.

## Week 3: React

React is a javascript library that allows you to right Component-based code, its reusable, modular code (e.g., navbar across pages).
